# DeepSeaGuard Dashboard - Implementation Guide

## Overview
DeepSeaGuard is a comprehensive compliance dashboard for monitoring and reporting on seabed mining operations according to ISA standards (ISBA/21/LTC/15). The dashboard provides real-time monitoring of environmental metrics, operational data, and compliance status with a split-screen layout featuring a 3D map view and detailed data panels.

## Features Implemented

### Core Dashboard Layout
- Split-screen design with 3D map view and data panels
- Dark mode interface optimized for maritime operations
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes

### Environmental Monitoring
- Sediment disturbance tracking with threshold visualization
- Water quality metrics (turbidity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen)
- Species proximity alerts with warning system

### Operational Data
- AUV position tracking and mission status
- Collection efficiency metrics
- Battery status monitoring with warnings

### Compliance Tracking
- ISA standards compliance status
- Ecological zone monitoring
- Reporting status and timeline

### Advanced Features
- Real-time alerting system with priority levels
- Time-lapse playback controls for historical data
- Data export capabilities

## Technical Implementation
- Built with React and Vite for optimal performance
- Modular component architecture for easy maintenance
- Mock data integration ready to connect to real APIs
- Chart.js integration for data visualization

## Running the Dashboard

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production**:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Connecting to Real Data

The dashboard is currently using mock data but is designed to connect to:
- Live AUV Telemetry Feed via ROS or custom API
- NOAA / ISA Oceanographic Data
- Remote Database (PostGIS / TimescaleDB)

To connect to real data sources:
1. Update the API endpoints in the data fetching functions
2. Implement authentication if required
3. Adjust data transformation to match your API response format

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. **3D Map Implementation**:
   - Integrate Three.js or Mapbox GL for 3D terrain visualization
   - Add real-time AUV position markers

2. **Real-time Data Connection**:
   - Implement WebSocket connections for live telemetry
   - Add data caching for offline operation

3. **Advanced Reporting**:
   - Develop automated ISA report generation
   - Add PDF export functionality

4. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Add secure login system
