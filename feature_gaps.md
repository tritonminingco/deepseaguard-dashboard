# DeepSeaGuard Feature Gap Analysis

## Current State
The DeepSeaGuard dashboard is currently in a prototype state with the following limitations:

### Map Visualization
- Using 2D Leaflet map instead of true 3D visualization
- All AUV positions and environmental data are mocked
- Sediment plume visualization is commented out
- No bathymetric data integration
- No real-time position tracking

### Data Integration
- All data is static mock data
- No API connections to real telemetry systems
- No historical data retrieval functionality
- No data persistence or storage
- Export functionality is not implemented

### Environmental Metrics
- Charts use mock data with no real-time updates
- No real sensor data integration
- No trend analysis or anomaly detection
- "View on Map" functionality not connected

### Operational Data
- All AUV status information is mocked
- No mission planning or control capabilities
- Battery status not connected to real telemetry
- No real-time efficiency metrics

### Compliance Monitoring
- ISA standards compliance is simulated
- No real reporting functionality to authorities
- No automated compliance checks
- No report generation capabilities

### Alerting System
- Alerts are static mock data
- No real-time event detection
- No alert history or management
- No notification system (email, SMS, etc.)

### Time Controls
- Historical playback is simulated
- No actual historical data retrieval
- No time-based filtering of real data

## Required Implementations for Full Functionality

### 3D Map Visualization
- Implement Three.js for true 3D visualization

- Add data transformation and normalization
- Implement data caching for offline operation
- Create authentication system for secure data access

### Historical Data Management
- Implement time-series database connection
- Create data retrieval service with time-based filtering
- Add data aggregation for different time scales
- Implement playback controls with actual historical data

### Environmental Monitoring
- Connect to real sensor data streams
- Implement trend analysis and anomaly detection
- Add threshold-based alerting
- Create visualization for environmental impact zones

### Operational Controls
- Implement mission status monitoring
- Add battery management with predictive analytics
- Create efficiency metrics with real-time calculations
- Implement collection rate monitoring

### Compliance Reporting
- Create automated ISA compliance checks
- Implement report generation in required formats
- Add scheduled reporting functionality
- Create compliance history and audit trail

### Alert Management
- Implement real-time event detection
- Create notification system with multiple channels
- Add alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking
- Implement alert prioritization and escalation

### User Interface Enhancements
- Add responsive design for all device sizes
- Implement user authentication and role-based access
- Create customizable dashboard layouts
- Add accessibility features
