# ISA Compliance Standards

The International Seabed Authority (ISA) has established environmental regulations for deep-sea mining operations. DeepSeaGuard monitors compliance with these standards in real-time.

## Environmental Standards

### ISA-ENV-1: Sediment Discharge Limit
- **Description**: Maximum allowable sediment discharge concentration
- **Threshold**: 25 mg/L
- **Monitoring**: Continuous real-time monitoring via AUV sensors
- **Reporting**: Required in monthly reports with daily averages

### ISA-ENV-2: Protected Species Proximity
- **Description**: Minimum distance to maintain from protected species
- **Threshold**: 100 meters
- **Monitoring**: Real-time detection via AUV cameras and sonar
- **Reporting**: Immediate alerts and incident reports for any violations

### ISA-ENV-3: Noise Level Limit
- **Description**: Maximum noise level during operations
- **Threshold**: 60 dB
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring via hydrophones
- **Reporting**: Required in monthly reports with hourly averages

## Operational Standards

### ISA-OPS-1: Collection Efficiency
- **Description**: Minimum efficiency rate for nodule collection
- **Threshold**: 80%
- **Monitoring**: Calculated based on collection rates and waste
- **Reporting**: Required in monthly reports
